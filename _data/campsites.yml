    Camp 9, a year-round facility, rests on the shores of Lake Isabella, a high
    desert reservoir. Its proximity to the lake and the Upper Kern River makes
    the facility popular among boaters, rafters and anglers. The camp is also a
    favorite among RV campers, with ample parking available to accommodate both
    trailers and motorized watercraft.
